# Pipeline to Instant
## Product delivery on a moments notice

---

# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Overall Goal
3. Workflow

---
      
# Introduction
      
## Wireless Lab

* Research
* Mobile
* Drones
      
---
      
# Overall Goal

## Working software over comprehensive documentation
- https://agilemanifesto.org/
      
### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
      
## What that really means?
* a branch is always ready for delivery
* "develop" or "main" can be given to the customer at all times
* epics, stories, tasks, bugs are all on single branches
      
---
      
# Workflow
      
## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
      
### At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

* daily scrum - hell or high water - regardless who is there
* retrospective is essential and manditory
  * airing of grievances - AKA complain publicly - everyone and anything
  * around the room - everyone says at least something
  * everyone can see these and what needs to improve
  * critical of ourselves and our actual work
* everyone picks their own work and what they want to work on
  * no single point of failure
  * personal growth
  * no silos of knowledge
  
---
      
# Workflow
      
## What this looks like in the process for our team
* tickets are created by anyone, anytime, all the time
* team reviews backlog after scrum masters have grouped items
* every developer writes testing instructions in their ticket
  * this does two interesting things
    * what the developer thought the requirements should be
    * what your team members thought it meant 

---
      
# Workflow
      
## Ticket Early Lifecycle
      
* identify
  * break down the ticket to simple english, add description and/or comments whenever it's confusing
  * days of work not hours - no more than 8 days per sprint per person subtract leave - respect live and work balance
* organize by like things
  * by epic, by feature
  * rally around a sprint goal - theme
  * research throws this completely off - and that's OK
  * the burn down charts mean nothing if something is learned and the software still works
      
---
      
# Workflow
      
## Ticket Actual Lifecycle      
* to do
  * pick your poison
* in progress
  * old way - update "build.sh test"
      * cppunit, unit testing, selenium testing
  * new way - just adding "robot framework" test - same script
* road block
  * scrum needs to know - fail fast duing scrum
* peer review
  * ticket is not ready for peer review unless it has - testing instructions
  * other developer checks the work start to fiinish and cross checks that the AC/story match what the code says it is
  * if anything doesn't work it goes back to in progress
* to fe or not to fe
  * selenium -> robot framework
* done

# Pipeline
    
## Quality
* clean phase "build.sh clean"
* analyis phase "build.sh analysis"
  * code quality
    * cppcheck
    * autopep8
    * pylint
    * pyflakes
    * flake8
    * future: bandit(?), third party
* testing phase "build.sh test"
  * runs the developer, functional, and other tests that needs to be run for that unit of code
* build phase "build.sh build"
  * obfuscated
      
## Simple Commands
  * build.sh
    * works on everyones box
    * same command works in .gitlab.yml - with no changes
### Keep it Simple

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

# Testing
## Third party just usually have to just see our process and are usaully good to go
* Hourly or less turn around on certain products in the past

# Rule of Third Times the Charm 
1. Learn how to do it
2. Refine and adjust
3. You should not be doing this again - this is the time to automate
