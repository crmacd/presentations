# Overall Goal

## Working software over comprehensive documentation
- https://agilemanifesto.org/
      
### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
      
## What that really means?
* a branch is always ready for delivery
* "develop" or "main" can be given to the customer at all times
* epics, stories, tasks, bugs are all on single branches

# Workflow
      
## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
      
### At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

* daily scrum - hell or high water - regardless who is there
* retrospective is essential and manditory
  * airing of grievances - AKA complain publicly - everyone and anything
  * around the room - everyone says at least something
  * everyone can see these and what needs to improve
  * critical of ourselves and our actual work
* everyone picks their own work and what they want to work on

# Workflow
      
## What this looks like in the process for our team
* tickets are created by anyone, anytime, all the time
* team reviews backlog after scrum masters have grouped items
* every developer writes testing instructions in their ticket
  * this does two interesting things - what the developer thought the requirements should be - vs. - what your team members thought it meant
