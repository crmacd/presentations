# Pipeline to Instant
## Product delivery on a moments notice

---

# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Overall Goal
3. Workflow
4. Pipeline

---
      
# Introduction
      
## Wireless Lab

* Research
* Mobile
* App Store
* Drones
      
---
      
# Overall Goal

## Working software over comprehensive documentation
- https://agilemanifesto.org/
      
### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
      
## What that really means?
* a branch is always ready for delivery
* "develop" or "main" can be given to the customer at all times
* epics, stories, tasks, bugs are all on single branches
      
---
      
# Workflow
      
## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
      
### At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

* daily scrum - hell or high water - regardless who is there
* retrospective is essential and manditory
  * airing of grievances - AKA complain publicly - everyone and anything
  * around the room - everyone says at least something
  * everyone can see these and what needs to improve
  * critical of ourselves and our actual work
* everyone picks their own work and what they want to work on
  # no single point of failure
  # personal growth
  # no silos of knowledge
  
---
      
# Workflow
      
## What this looks like in the process for our team
* tickets are created by anyone, anytime, all the time
* team reviews backlog after scrum masters have grouped items
* every developer writes testing instructions in their ticket
  * this does two interesting things
    # what the developer thought the requirements should be
    # what your team members thought it meant 

---
      
# Workflow
      
## Ticket Early Lifecycle
      
* identify
  * break down the ticket to simple english, add description and/or comments whenever it's confusing
  * days of work not hours - no more than 8 days per sprint per person subtract leave - respect live and work balance
* organize by like things
  * by epic, by feature
  * rally around a sprint goal - theme
  * research throws this completely off - and that's OK
  * the burn down charts mean nothing if something is learned and the software still works
      
---
      
# Workflow
      
## Ticket Actual Lifecycle
      
* to do
  * pick your poison
* in progress
  * old way - update "build.sh test"
      * cppunit, unit testing, selenium testing
  * new way - just adding "robot framework" test - same script
      * allows for adding anything "new" that comes up ... hint: new .gov requirements incoming
  * goal is always green
* road block
  * scrum needs to know - fail fast duing scrum
      
---
      
# Workflow
      
## Ticket Actual Lifecycle (cont)
      
* peer review
  * ticket is not ready for peer review unless it has - testing instructions
  * other developer checks the work start to fiinish and cross checks that the AC/story match what the code says it is
  * if anything doesn't work it goes back to in progress
* to fe or not to fe
  * selenium -> robot framework
* done

---
      
# Workflow
      
## Before Release
* Clean up tickets, backlog, and branches
* merge order matters for testing release
* ALWAYS - final release sprint
  * last minute bugs
  * full matrix testing
    # testing everything against CNF and acceptance critera
    # for us that means different devices and different versions
  * everyone tests on the entire team - everyone
* constant improvement
      
---
   
# Pipeline
      
## Responding to change over following a plan
      
### Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
      
## Simple Commands
  * build.sh
    * works on everyones box
    * same command works in .gitlab.yml - with no changes
## Keep it Simple
  * Super, super, serious folks - stop if it's not runnable by everyone after three interations
      
## Hint
  * build.sh includes the package dependancies needed at the start if not it installs them or checks them and fails fast telling you what's not working within reason
      
---      
      
# Pipeline
    
## Quality
* clean phase "build.sh clean"
  * clean all the things!
* analyis phase "build.sh analysis"
  * code quality
    * cppcheck
    * autopep8
    * pylint
    * pyflakes
    * flake8
    * future: bandit(?), third party
* testing phase "build.sh test"
  * runs the developer, functional, and other tests that needs to be run for that unit of code
      
## Build Consistently
* removes people dependancy - anyone can do any role in the lab
* build phase "build.sh build"
  * obfuscated
      
---
      
# Pipeline
      
## Run gitlab Runner Run
* docker swarm - small cloud
* gitlab runners - shell to run docker instances of build environment
  * same docker that the developers use is the same one the pipeline uses, duh! KISS
* bare metal for hardware in the loop
  * mobile devices - adb usb - shell script running separately - json web services kick on commands
## Where we are at
* project is submodule of testing repo so that pipeline for building project is separate so robot framework docker and testing processes runs independent of project builds and pipeline with existing runners

---
      
# Testing

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

## Third party testing groups usually have to just see our process and are usually good to go
* Hourly or less turn around on certain products in the past
      
## Customer gets several release candidates before final release
      
## Rule of Third Times the Charm 
1. Learn how to do it
2. Refine and adjust
3. You should not be doing this again - this is the time to automate
