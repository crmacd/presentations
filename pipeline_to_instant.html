# Overall Goal

## Working software over comprehensive documentation
- https://agilemanifesto.org/
      
### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
      
## What that really means?
* a branch is always ready for delivery
* "develop" or "main" can be given to the customer at all times
* epics, stories, tasks, bugs are all on a single branches

# Workflow
      
## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Daily scrum - hell or high water - regardless who is there
* Retrospective is essential and manditory
  * airing of grievances - AKA complain publicly - everyone and anything
* Everyone picks their own work and what they want to work on
